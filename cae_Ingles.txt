Many years later, in front of the shooting squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had to remember that remote afternoon in which his father took him to know the ice. Macondo was then a village of twenty mud and cañabrava houses built on the edge of a river of diaphanous waters that rushed through a bed of polished stones, white and huge as prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent, that many things lacked in its name, and to mention them you would have to point out with the finger. Every year, for the month of March, a family of uprooted gypsies planted their tent near the village, and with a large fuss of pitos and timbales they announced the new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A corpulent gypsy, from a mountain beard and gorrión hands, who appeared with the name of Melquiades, made a truculent public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the wise alchemists of Macedonia.
